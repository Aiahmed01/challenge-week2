# week-2-challenge notes
I change a lot why i was working and this week i have the minimum commits because my terminal was having an issue and i fixed it with the help of TA. The issue was that i wasn't paying attention that when i was pushing i was using https link and it was asking for verifications and a lot of fetal errors was showing in my terminal.
